Achain
=========
Achain is one new blockchain based on BTS1.0 which integrates lua virtual machine based smart contracts, yet a software platform designed to help coordinate voluntary free market operations amongst a set of social actors.

Achain is making efforts to build up a high performance discentralized enterprise blockchain platform, to develop business blockchain applications, to eliminate cognitive fear of the enterprises facing blockchain technology or corresponding applications, to make the blockchain visualized and configurable.

Replicas of the state machine are kept consistent using the Result Delegated Proof-of-Stake distributed consensus protocol.
